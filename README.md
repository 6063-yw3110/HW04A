I have actually severall ideas at first but after I tried to consider achieve these in coding, I gave up since I found I had no clue to write these

so I even search tutorials for my earth moon idea but just hard to understand..so i gave up

Then it occurred to me what it would be like to show my clock in the middle, with some random sized and colored balls appearing next to it as the seconds increased, so I probably thought about some drafts, and I thought it might work well. I also searched some new functions that I want my hours 
shows as 00 00 00 in this format.

At first I always had trouble figuring out how to set up the little balls to appear over timeï¼ˆas the second increase). I read some tutorials and learned how to turn on the time, but simply making the blob appear would be boring. I think it's more important to make the ball change with the framing of the time! Then I NOTICE I should add framerate(1) so refereshing every one second.

I learnt "return" that if i want a 000000 format.

the first version

not that happy with this, think it is not designed enough(as a designer I'm very strict with typefaces lol)..so I feel like I need to change the text font, I think I need a mono font better fits a "clock" like font. BUT I tried but still don't understand how to get the URL from my typefaces
if I want my own typefaces displayed.

second version
so i just pulled up another typeface and make it fullscreen. I used to have : : : to separeted the hrs, mins and secs but I still want it to look 
nicer, so I removed : and add a + at the front.

but still not satisfied, so i make my text smaller and move it at the bottom, this is the final version

*I NOTICED THAT textAlign is so important.make life easier

*But I noticed that as I leave the window than go back, the balls does not running itself. it will only run when i am ON the page
so I may want to learn a new tool to let the ball accumalte itself even I am not 'on' that screen
